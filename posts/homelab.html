        <h1 id="Title">My Homelab</h1>
        <p>My homelab is running off of a Dell Optiplex that I bought used with an I7-6700 and 32gb of ram that is running proxmox to serve all my virtual machine needs. 
            I have two networks running on proxmox, the first that is on my home network that has proxmox, a minecraft server, and Pfsense. 
            Behind Pfsense is my virtual network that I use to play around with all the machines and tools that I am interested in, along with attempting to simulate a somewhat corporate network.
             Putting good practice into vlans and keeping the network segmented for better security, performance, and containment. On that virtual network I have an Active Directory environment, SOC environment, and a Malware Analysis environment.</p>
