    <h1 class="aboutme">My Homelab</h1>
    <p class="aboutme-paragraph">My homelab is running off of a Dell Optiplex that I bought used with an I7-6700 and 32gb of ram that is running proxmox to serve all my virtual machine needs. 
        I have two networks running on proxmox, the first that is on my home network that has proxmox, a minecraft server, and Pfsense. 
        Behind Pfsense is my virtual network that I use to play around with all the machines and tools that I am interested in, along with attempting to simulate a somewhat corporate network.
         Putting good practice into vlans and keeping the network segmented for better security, performance, and containment. On that virtual network I have an Active Directory environment, SOC environment, and a Malware Analysis environment.
