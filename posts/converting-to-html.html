        <h1 id="Title1">Idea</h1>
        <p>I was bored one day and decided to make a program that takes a txt file that is formatted similar to markdown and converts it to a html file for my blog posts. I got this idea from when I first made this site it was using a jekyll static site generator and I liked how easy it was to make new posts, however when I decided to write this site from scratch I lost that, until now. I enjoyed this project, it was a little challenging at first because it has been a bit since I used python but I picked it up again pretty quickly. The code is definitly rough and there probably is better and more efficient ways to do what I did, however I did it all from scratch with some help from w3schools so I am pretty proud of it. I will eventually add more to the program like supporting hyperlinks and automatically adding the new post to the posts page however I want to get this published first</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h1 id="Title2">Code</h1>
        <p>The code was made specifically for my site however it can be edited to fit others and feel free to use the code for your own site if you would like and please credit if you do. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/TylerPreisner/convert-to-html">here</a></p>
        <p>The txt file formating is as so:</p>

        <div class="codeblock">
          <div class="codeblock-header"></div>
          <div class="codeblock-text">
            <p class="shell"></p>
            <p>head;the title of the post;the description;</p>
            <p>title;the title of the section;</p>
            <p>paragraph;the content of the section;</p>
            <p>code;the content of the code block;</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h1 id="Title3">Plans</h1>
          <p>My plans for this program in the future is of course to add support for more options like hyper links and images or videos and to complete the entire workflow of making and publishing a blog post.
            I want to just put the file in a folder and have it automatically build out the html and push it to github.</p>
