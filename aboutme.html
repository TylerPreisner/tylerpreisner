    <h1 class="welcome">About Me</h1>
    <p class="welcome-paragraph">I am a self taught IT and Cyber Security enthusiast, first discovering about this interest in early of 2023.
         I completed Google’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support">IT Support</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity">Cyber Security</a> Courses on Coursera in the middle of 2023. 
         I enjoyed those a lot, it was fun learning new concepts and getting practice with them using their labs. 
         I am currently studying for the comptia A+ while also going through Cisco’s Networking Basics course on <a href="https://skillsforall.com">skills for all</a> along with various learning on tryhackme and hackthebox. 
         I also have a homelab setup for practicing and learning on my own with a post documenting the design coming later.
